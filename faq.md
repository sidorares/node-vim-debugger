We should use the gitignore from github . They have sane default

Why are these files on the gitignore list ? the one i can kind of understand would be npm-debug.log but test rest not sure 
*.seed
*.log
*.csv
*.dat
*.out
*.pid
*.gz

pids
logs
results

npm-debug.log

what does jvd stand for ?
we use jvd to abbreviate javscript vim debugger ( jvd )
